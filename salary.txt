Salary Structure Guidelines

1. Monthly Salary
Definition: The fixed amount an employee receives every month before deductions.
- It includes basic pay, allowances, and benefits.
Example: If basic pay = 40,000 and allowances = 10,000, then monthly salary = 50,000.
Another Example: A software engineer may receive 55,000 per month including HRA and transport allowance.

2. Annual Salary
Definition: The total salary earned in a year, usually excluding one-time bonuses.
- Formula: Annual Salary = Monthly Salary × 12.
Example: If monthly salary = 50,000, then annual salary = 600,000 (before deductions).
Another Example: A manager earning 80,000 per month has an annual salary of 960,000.

3. Deductions
Definition: Amounts subtracted from gross salary to calculate net salary.
- Common deductions include:
  a. Income Tax (depends on tax slab)
  b. Provident Fund (PF) – usually 12% of basic pay
  c. Professional Tax – fixed small amount depending on state
Example: If monthly salary = 60,000 and deductions = 7,000, net monthly salary = 53,000.
Another Example: PF deduction of 4,800 (12% of 40,000 basic) reduces take-home salary.

4. Bonuses
Definition: Additional payments given by the company, usually based on performance or festive occasions.
- Not part of fixed monthly or annual salary.

Another Example: A Diwali bonus of 10,000 is given as a one-time payment.

5. Payslip
Definition: Official document that summarizes an employee’s earnings and deductions for a given month.
- Includes: gross salary, deductions, and net salary.
Example: Payslip shows Gross = 60,000, Deductions = 7,000, Net = 53,000.
Another Example: Payslip may also list bonus or overtime earnings separately.

6. Example Calculation

Example:
- Gross monthly salary = 60,000.

- Net monthly salary = 53,000.
- Annual gross salary = 60,000 × 12 = 720,000.

Another Example:
- Gross monthly = 80,000, deductions = 10,000.
